		        <h2>Good Ways To Learn Video Editing</h2>
		        <p>When I had no idea how to video edit, I didn't have reliable sites like this.  So, I had to improvise.  There are tons of good ways to figure out how to edit.  The best start is, YouTube.  With YouTube there are tons of visual tutorials, for more of the visual learners.  There are great channel to watch like Peter McKinnon.  He gives tons of tutorials on how to edit on a pro level, I myself am not as talented as he is.  That is the most reliable way of getting information on the topic of editing on Adobe premiere pro.</p>

		      <h2 id="here">Steps To Make The Compilation</h2>
		      <p>It doesn't take much to make a compilation.  There are a few precautions you must take just for the reason that it will look better.  When you see the blur on the sides that is zoomed up it is because the borders used to be black.  Now it is way more polished.  To make the borders like that, what you want to do is first compile all your clips togeter in the order you want to.  Then, whta you want to do is take out all the stuff you don't need to by cutting it off. When you finish that, then you can copy the clip and paste the same clip above your original clip.  Now you have two clips, one original clip and one clip for effects. Also, in the ne copied clip, unlink the audio and delete it.  Afterwards you go to the "Effects" section and search up "Gaussian Blur" and hold the effect, and drag it into one of your clips.  Go to "Effect Controls" and position the one with Gaussian Blur to 960 by 624.  Scale it to 178, and the rest leave default.  Then, make the Gaussion Blur blurriness to 92.0.  The dimensions should be Horizontal and Vertical by default, but if it isn't then change it to that.  Then , what you want to do after that is go back on "Effects" and search up drop shadow.  Take that effect and drag it to your other clip.  Then, leave everything default up until the drop shadow settings.  Choose your shadow color and change the opacity to 50%.  Make the direction 135.0Â°.  Make the distance 18.0 and softness 63.0.  Now you have a nice shadow for the transition into the Gaussion Blur.  That is basically all, it is very simple but it is also effective.  If you have any questions you can DM me on my Instagram, just click the icon of the camera next to the YouTube Icon.</p>
